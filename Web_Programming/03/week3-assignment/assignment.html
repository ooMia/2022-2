      <article>
        <p> Web-programming is the work involved in programming a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
          intranet (a private network). This can range from programming a simple single static page of
          plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more
          comprehensive list of tasks to which Web programming commonly refers, may include Web engineering,
          Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and
          network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>

        <!-- Aarticle represents a self-contained composition,

        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure
          the web pages you visit. HTML is the language that we use to structure the different parts of our
          content and define what their meaning or purpose is. HTML is the language made up of elements, which can be
          applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document, structure a document into
          logical sections, and embed content such as images and videos into a page.</p>
        <p>Especially, HTML5 is the fifth and final major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium
          (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained
          by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium of the major browser
          vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).</p>

    <section id="CSS3">
      <h2>CSS3</h2>
      <article>
        <p>CSS is the language that we can use to style and layout our web content, as well as adding
          behavior like animation. Cascading Style Sheets — or CSS — is the first technology you should start learning
          after HTML. While HTML is used to define the structure and semantics of your content, CSS is used to
          style it and lay it out. For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your
          content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike CSS 2, which is a large single specification defining various features, CSS 3 is divided
          into several separate documents called "modules". Each module adds new capabilities or extends
          features defined in CSS 2, preserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS level 3 started around the time
          of publication of the original CSS 2 recommendation. The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in
          June 1999.

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <article>
        <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated to JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the
          World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the
          client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers
          have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices. Every time a web page does
          more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at—displaying timely content
          updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, or more—you can bet that
          JavaScript is probably involved. </p>
        <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
          standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
          It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has
          application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
          standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
